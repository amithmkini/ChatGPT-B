This is a (very) basic frontend for ChatGPT API entirely built by querying ChatGPT itself. There is no code added explictly by me.

1. Clone the repository
2. Install node modules: `npm install`
3. Do the same for the client folder: `cd client && npm install`
4. Copy the `.env.local.example` file to `.env.local` and fill in the required fields.
5. cd back to the root folder: `cd ..`
6. Start the docker container: `docker-compose up -d` or have MongoDB running on your machine/Atlas.
7. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the required fields.
8. Start the server: `npm run dev`
